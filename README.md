Video Demonstration Notice

Unfortunately, I was unable to record and upload a video demonstration due to time and technical constraints. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

As the pages are not fully linked yet, I kindly request you to view each HTML page individually by opening them directly in the browser. Each page has been designed to reflect the intended user journey.


üåü Notable MVP Features:

Carbon Footprint Tracker
Each swap action dynamically reflects the environmental impact ‚Äî showing how much water is saved or CO‚ÇÇ reduced, encouraging conscious consumption.

Swap Stories
A dedicated space where users can share personal stories and emotions behind their swaps, adding a human and emotional dimension to sustainable fashion.

Thank you for your understanding and time! I truly hope the code and design convey the heart behind the project, even without the video.
